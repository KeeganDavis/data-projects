Interestingly, History is also the highest-rated genre on average, while Musicals are the lowest. Notably, 70% of the genres have an average runtime of over two hours (120 minutes). History, Western, and Biographical genres are the only ones to exceed 165 minutes in average runtime, suggesting that these genres may require more time for story development compared to shorter genres like Comedy and Romance.
