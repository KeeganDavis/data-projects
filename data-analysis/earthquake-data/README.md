# leaflet-challenge
## Description
The index.html file and the logic.js file work together to display the world map and plot the location of earthquakes. Each marker has a popup when clicked that contains the location, magnitude, and depth of the earthquake. The color of the markers depends on the depth of the earthquake and the legend shows the color for the depth ranges. This data dynamically updates as the USGS data updates.
