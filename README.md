# data-projects
Welcome to my data projects repository. This repository contains a collection of my data analysis and data science projects.

## Data Analysis Projects

1. [Pymaceuticals](data-analysis/pymaceuticals/)
    - Description: Analyzing the impact of drug regimens on tumor volume in mice using summary statistics and visualizations to identify promising treatments.
2. [NBA Data Analysis](data-analysis/nba-analysis)
    - Description: Analyzing NBA datasets to identify trends among teams and players.
3. [Belly Button Samples](data-analysis/belly-button-samples/)
    - Description: Visualizing the different bacteria in the belly button samples using bar charts and bubble plots.
4. [Earthquake Visualization](data-analysis/earthquake-data/)
    - Description: Using Leaflet to plot the earthquakes on the world map with the size of the circle corresponding to the magnitude.
5. [Natural Disasters Visualization](data-analysis/natural-disasters-dataset/)
    - Description: Creating a webpage using Leaflet and Python plotting software to visualize the distribution of various natural disasters across the world. The aim is to visualize the distribution of natural disasters across the world, identify patterns based on different regions of the world, and determine if certain countries with higher populations experience more natural disasters.
6. [Citi Bike Analysis](data-analysis/citi-bike-tableau/)
    - Description: Analyzing the Citi Bike data to identify the most popular starting and ending stations, identify the most popular hours, determine when the longest ride times occur, assess which types of Citi Bikes people use, and compare ride durations and user numbers between members and casual riders.
7. [Online Sales Dataset](data-analysis/online-sales-dataset/)
    - Description: Analyzing online sales data to uncover insights and trends. This project focuses on product categories, sales volume, revenue distribution, and payment methods to provide actionable recommendations.


## Data Science Projects

1. [Crypto Clusters](data-science/crypto-clusters/)
    - Description: Using k-means clustering and PCA to create clusters based on the 24-hour and 7-day price changes of cryptocurrencies.
2. [Investment Predictions](data-science/investment-predictions/)
    - Description: Using a neural network to predict if the applicant for investment money will be successful in their ventures.
3. [Credit Risk Classification](data-science/credit-risk-classification/)
    - Description: Using supervised machine learning to predict if a loan is high risk or healthy.
4. [Tennis Match Predictions](data-science/tennis-predictions/)
    - Description: Using random forest and neural networks to predict the winner of tennis matches based on historical match data.



Each project folder contains the necessary code, data, and documentation to understand and reproduce the analysis.
